Zotero was a new term I discovered. This is along with Discord and Hypothesis. 
I did not know what these programs were. 
Github is a new thing for me as well, I have never heard of it as a place to keep files. 
The websites I used to help me were the same ones the professor posted. It was pretty straight forward in downloading the applications on my Mac. 
I enjoyed listening to the podcasts. I wish all of the classes were like that, it is so much easier than Zoom calls.
